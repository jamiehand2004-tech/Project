After many trials and tribulations, here is our final project for COMP2603 (Programming 1). 

It's certainly been a harrowing few weeks, but we have created something that works and fulfills the deliverables of the brief.


It is a Multi-User Quiz Application, with save-states for both users and questions/quizzes. 


## Description/Deliverables:

A console application that allows users to take C++ quizzes and receive scores.
- User registration and login
- Create quizzes with multiple-choice questions
- Allow users to take quizzes and see their scores
- Leaderboard to display top scores
- Save quiz data and user scores to a file

## Roles:

- Quiz Logic: Implements the quiz-taking and scoring mechanics.
- User Management: Manages user accounts and score tracking.
- User Interface: Designs the quiz navigation and displays results.

We would like to invite you to try it out and see for yourselves!

It is as it says on the tin, essentially a project version of a Kahoot/Quizlet mixed with an arcade game scorecard, to keep track of your endeavors.
Enjoy!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C++ 

Made on Visual Studio Code using C++, we learned alot about C++ over the course of the project. Through the use of .h and .cpp files, we were able to create a class system that pulled from the header files. This was able to improve upon previous iterations that we had in terms of the cleanliness and overall performance of the project.

## Lessons Learned:

The lessons learned by the team were that:
- Ambiguous or changing requirements early on led to conflicts. Next time, we’ll invest more effort in clarifying user requirements and section assignments before writing code.
- Scheduling conflicts caused issues, but were resolved using online calls.
- Workload issues created stress and conflict in the group. This was resolved using proper communication and deliberation on behalf of all members, with some slight issues persisting to present day.
